# This vocabulary is based on the document created by T.Ullrich in the summer of 2020.
#
# It differs from Thomas' list in the following - due to a very large overlap of the document
# types proposed by Thomas, with the natively supported types in Zenodo we shall rely on the
# native types for the time being (e.g. "presentation", "working paper", "publication" etc)
#
# The rest of the content is presented below and grouped into specific categories:
